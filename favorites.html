          <h2>Shoes</h2>

          <p>I have a collection of 36 pairs of shoes. There are many shoes 
            for different purposes such as for basketball, running, casual wear,
            formal event, etc. I have always loved shoes growing up but I was able 
            to start growing my collection once my foot growth slowed down around 
            9th grade. I have only grown half a size since so I'm still able to wear
             a lot of my shoes. My most favorite pairs are my Kobe 6s, Jordan 4s, New 
             Balance 992, and VaporMax Flyknit. I will continue to keep collecting shoes.

          <h2>Basketball</h2>
  
          <p>I have been playing basketball consistenly for the past year, but I have been around the sport since I was in First grade. I enjoy watching the NBA and its highlights on youtube and sometimes I'll take the time to watch a whole game. My instagram feed also has a lot of basketball related content.</p> 
          <p>As of right now my favorite player is Luka Doncic(The guy above^) of the Dallas Mavericks. His game is very versatile and unique which is why I like him as a player. I tend to incorporate his playstyle into the way I play basketball. This includes using variations of the stepback to generate space, using a lot of hang dribbles to keep the defender guessing, and taking deep threes(Taking threes is a skill, don't just chuck them up).  </p>

          <h2>Legos</h2>
  
          <p>I have been playing with Legos ever since I was a little kid because my parents, family, and family friends would often buy me them. However, I started to collect Legos again when the pandemic began. Since then I have bought a good amount of legos that are now sitting around my room. I have different Lego builds such as cars, action figures, trains, and heads. To be more specific about the heads, I have one Bat Man head, one Storm Trooper head, one Darth Vader head, and one Venom Head(shown above). I enjoy building legos because it reminds me of my childhood and helps decorate my room.</p>
